    <h1 class="about-heading">How it works?</h1>
    <p data-aos="slide-up">
Our platform streamlines the faculty self-appraisal process through an intuitive system. Faculty members register, log
in, and create a profile, then input details about their academic activities, such as research, seminars, and teaching.
This information is updated in real-time for easy review and
edits. Administrators use the Admin Panel to sort submissions by Name, Employee Code, or Date, and can generate detailed
PDF reports for analysis. This process ensures accurate records and supports informed decision-making, enhancing faculty
development and institutional excellence
